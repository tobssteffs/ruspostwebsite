The legal basis of the data processing is Art. 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. In addition to this, our company may be obliged by the law to process your data to comply with legal requirements under German or EU regulations, e.g. mail seizure in the event of a criminal investigation under Sec. 99 of the German Code of Criminal Procedure, notification obligation to courts and public authorities under Sec.40 of the German Postal Act, etc. In such case, the processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 (1)(c) of the GDPR.</p><p><strong>Storage period</strong></p><p>Your personal data will be deleted by us as soon as the purpose of storage no longer applies and the data no longer needs to be stored in accordance with legally prescribed retention period. In this case, the data will be deleted after the legally prescribed retention period has expired. </p><p><strong>Recipients or categories of recipients</strong></p><p>Data is shared with the companies which are involved in the provision of postal and delivery services. Data can be also shared within the scope of fulfilment of legal obligations (e.g. with the investigating or customs authorities). </p><p>The above-mentioned controllers do not sell, transfer or otherwise share your data with third parties themselves, and will not do so in thefuture, unless this is required by law, or is necessary for the purposes of thecontract, or you have consented to such transfer of the data. For example, in the case of postal services, your address data may be passed on to the companies involved in the transportation process (e.g. courier service providers, customs service providers and, in the case of non-postal services, sanction screening service providers to check against the sanction lists).</p><p>External service providers processing the data on behalf of RusPost GmbH (e.g. for customer services, IT services) provide sufficient guarantees that appropriate technical and organisational measures are implemented in such a way that the data processing is carried out in line with the requirements ofthe GDPR. In accordance with Art. 28 of the GDPR, they are contractually obliged, among other things, to maintain strict confidentiality. In these cases, RusPost GmbH remains responsible for the protection of your personal data. The external service providers only process the personal data on the documented instructions by RusPost GmbH.</p><p><strong>Data transfer to the Russian Federation</strong></p><p>When goods are shipped to the Russian Federation, the delivery of the goods to the recipient is carried out by JSC Russian Post, 2A, 3-rd Peschannaya, 125252 Moscow, Russia. For the purpose of performance of the contract(Art. 6 (1)(b) of the GDPR), the data is therefore transferred to JSC RussianPost, Moscow, Russia.</p><p>Russia is a so-called third country (country outside the European Unionor the European Economic Area). The transfer of the recipient’s data is necessary for the performance of the respective transportation contract (e.g. shipment delivery). If a transfer to a third country is performed by RusPost GmbH, thisis only carried out on the basis of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses or under the GDPR exceptions.</p><p><strong>5.

The legal basis is therefore Art. 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. In addition to this, our company may be obliged by the law to process your data to comply with legal requirements under German or EU regulations, e.g. mail seizure in the event of a criminal investigation under Sec. 99 of the German Code of Criminal Procedure, notification obligation to courts and public authorities under Sec. 40 of the German Postal Act, etc. In such case, the processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 (1)(c) of the GDPR.</p><p><strong>Recipients or categories of recipients</strong></p><p>If necessary as a part of request processing, the data may be transferred to another group company. In the event of damage, it may also be necessary to share the data with insurance companies. In addition to this, the data may be shared within the scope of fulfilment of legal obligations (e.g. with investigating authorities). </p><p><strong>Transfer to a third country</strong></p><p>Dealing with the requests may require involvement of companies outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, in particular involvement of the JSC Russian Post, 2A, 3-rd Peschannaya, 125252 Moscow, Russia. However, transferof personal data takes place only if there is an adequacy decision by the European Commission or other appropriate data protection safeguards (e.g.binding corporate rules or EU Standard Contractual Clauses). </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>6.
